# Plant-Go :seedling:

Plant.Go is an Android application that allows the user to easily keep track of the plants grown in an orchard through a local database that stores the plant data, with the possibility of modifying or deleting them according to the user's need.

It was developed as a project for the course of "Mobile Applications" at the CETIS 26 Technical Highschool on June 2021.

## Installation

To install the application, you must have Android Studio installed on your computer. Then, you must clone the repository and open it in Android Studio. Once the project is open, you can run it on an emulator or on a physical device.

## Usage

The application has a simple interface, with a main screen that shows the list of plants in the database, and a button to add a new plant. The user can click on a plant to see its details, and can click on the edit button to modify the plant's data, or on the delete button to remove it from the database.
